# Azure Architecture Solutions

This repository contains a curated collection of **Azure architecture designs** based on **real-world enterprise scenarios**.

It reflects how I approach **system design, trade-offs, and architectural decisions** when building scalable, secure, and resilient platforms on Microsoft Azure.

The focus is on **architecture and reasoning**, not on application source code.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a **professional architecture portfolio**.

It captures:
- How requirements are translated into architectural decisions
- How scalability, availability, and resilience are addressed
- How Azure services are combined to solve concrete problems
- Why certain choices are made over others

Rather than presenting “ideal” architectures, the emphasis is on **pragmatic, production-oriented designs**.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Architectures are organized by **problem domain or scenario**.

Each case typically includes:
- A clear problem statement and constraints
- One or more architecture diagrams
- Key design decisions and their rationale
- Trade-offs and alternatives that were intentionally not chosen

The goal is to make the **decision-making process explicit**, not just the final diagram.

---

## 📐 Architectures & Scenarios

All scenarios are:
- **Anonymized**
- **Inspired by real production experience**
- Designed with **enterprise constraints in mind**
- Focused on cloud-native and hybrid Azure environments

They do not represent any specific customer, company, or internal system.

## 🧭 Scope & Intent

This repository is intentionally:
- **Architecture-focused**
- **Implementation-agnostic**
- **Cloud-provider aware**, but not tied to a single product feature set

Details such as CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, and application code are considered **out of scope**, unless they are directly relevant to an architectural decision.
